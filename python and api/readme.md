# Making HTTP Requests in Python

In Python, you can interact with web services, APIs, and websites by making HTTP requests. This is commonly done using libraries like **`requests`**, which simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses. This document will guide you through the process of making HTTP requests in Python.

## Prerequisites
Before you start making HTTP requests in Python, you should have the **`requests`** library installed. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using **`pip`**:

```bash
pip install requests
```
